# GifTastic
A dynamic web page that consists of various gifs using a GIPHY API

Each button displayed, when pressed, will generate exactly 10 gifs of the particular person whose name is displayed on said button.

The user can add additional buttons to the document by entering and submitting a name or keyword of their choice (NBA players in this instance), and those buttons too will accomodate their request by supplying 10 random gifs of the newly added name.

This occurs due to an GIPHY API key which calls these actions from a large GIF libray.
